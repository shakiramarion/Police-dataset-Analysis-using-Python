# Police-dataset-Analysis-using-Python
This project involves analyzing a police dataset using Python to extract insights about traffic stops, including details such as stop dates, times, driver demographics, violations, and outcomes. The dataset comprises 65,535 entries with 15 attributes, allowing for key analyses that examine gender differences in speeding stops, the impact of gender on search rates during stops, and the average duration of stops. This comprehensive approach provides valuable insights into policing patterns and driver demographics over time.
